# Custom theme for LightPaper
My custom theme for [LightPaper](http://lightpaper.42squares.in/) markdown editor for Mac.


### Adding Custom Themes to LightPaper

You can write your own themes or use already available themes by just dropping them under `~/.lightpaper/Themes` directory. You can also put themes under a subdirectory as well as just clone a repo and **LightPaper for Mac** will pick them up without any extra efforts on your side. Files ending in `.txt` are counted as editor themes while files ending in `.css` are counted as preview themes. 

Clone the theme under `~/.lightpaper/Themes` and you are all set. You can select a theme for the editor and/ or for the preview from the Preferences pane (`LightPaper>Preferences…` or `⌘,`). If two themes share the same name, only one of them will be picked. If you want to write your own theme, we recommend you to use one of the above mentioned themes as a template.
